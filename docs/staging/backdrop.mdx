title: Backdrop
sourcecode: src/core/Backdrop.tsx

<Grid cols={4}>
  <li>
    <Codesandbox id="8yfnd" />
  </li>
</Grid>

A curved plane, like a studio backdrop. This is for presentational purposes, to break up light and shadows more interestingly.

```jsx
<Backdrop
  floor={0.25} // Stretches the floor segment, 0.25 by default
  segments={20} // Mesh-resolution, 20 by default
>
  <meshStandardMaterial color="#353540" />
</Backdrop>
```
