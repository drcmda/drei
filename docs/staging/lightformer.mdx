<Grid cols={4}>
  <li>
    <Codesandbox id="lwo219" />
  </li>
</Grid>

This component draws flat rectangles, circles or rings, mimicking the look of a light-former. You can set the output `intensity`, which will effect emissiveness once you put it into an HDRI `<Environment>`, where it mostly belong. It will act like a real light without the expense, you can have as many as you want.

```jsx
<Environment>
  <Lightformer
    form="rect" // circle |Â ring | rect (optional, default = rect)
    intensity={1} // power level (optional = 1)
    color="white" // (optional = white)
    scale={[10, 5]} // Scale it any way you prefer (optional = [1, 1])
    target={[0, 0, 0]} // Target position (optional = undefined)
  />
```
