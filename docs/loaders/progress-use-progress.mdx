A convenience hook that wraps `THREE.DefaultLoadingManager`'s progress status.

```jsx
function Loader() {
  const { active, progress, errors, item, loaded, total } = useProgress()
  return <Html center>{progress} % loaded</Html>
}

return (
  <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
    <AsyncModels />
  </Suspense>
)
```

If you don't want your progress component to re-render on all changes you can be specific as to what you need, for instance if the component is supposed to collect errors only. Look into [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) for more info about selectors.

```jsx
const errors = useProgress((state) => state.errors)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Note that your loading component does not have to be a suspense fallback. You can use it anywhere, even in your dom tree, for instance for overlays.
