A declarative, `three.MeshLine` based Trails implementation. You can attach it to any mesh and it will give it a beautiful trail.

Props defined below with their default values.

```jsx
<Trail
  width={0.2} // Width of the line
  color={'hotpink'} // Color of the line
  length={1} // Length of the line
  decay={1} // How fast the line fades away
  local={false} // Wether to use the target's world or local positions
  stride={0} // Min distance between previous and current point
  interval={1} // Number of frames to wait before next calculation
  target={undefined} // Optional target. This object will produce the trail.
  attenuation={(width) => width} // A function to define the width in each point along it.
>
  {/* If `target` is not defined, Trail will use the first `Object3D` child as the target. */}
  <mesh>
    <sphereGeometry />
    <meshBasicMaterial />
  </mesh>

  {/* You can optionally define a custom meshLineMaterial to use. */}
  {/* <meshLineMaterial color={"red"} /> */}
</Trail>
```
