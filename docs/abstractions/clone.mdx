Declarative abstraction around THREE.Object3D.clone. This is useful when you want to create a shallow copy of an existing fragment (and Object3D, Groups, etc) into your scene, for instance a group from a loaded GLTF. This clone is now re-usable, but it will still refer to the original geometries and materials.

```ts
<Clone
  /** Any pre-existing THREE.Object3D (groups, meshes, ...), or an array of objects */
  object: THREE.Object3D | THREE.Object3D[]
  /** Children will be placed within the object, or within the group that holds arrayed objects */
  children?: React.ReactNode
  /** Can clone materials and/or geometries deeply (default: false) */
  deep?: boolean | 'materialsOnly' | 'geometriesOnly'
  /** The property keys it will shallow-clone (material, geometry, visible, ...) */
  keys?: string[]
  /** Can either spread over props or fill in JSX children, applies to every mesh within */
  inject?: MeshProps | React.ReactNode | ((object: THREE.Object3D) => React.ReactNode)
  /** Short access castShadow, applied to every mesh within */
  castShadow?: boolean
  /** Short access receiveShadow, applied to every mesh within */
  receiveShadow?: boolean
/>
```

You create a shallow clone by passing a pre-existing object to the `object` prop.

```jsx
const { nodes } = useGLTF(url)
return (
  <Clone object={nodes.table} />
```

Or, multiple objects:

```jsx
<Clone object={[nodes.foo, nodes.bar]} />
```

You can dynamically insert objects, these will apply to anything that isn't a group or a plain object3d (meshes, lines, etc):

```jsx
<Clone object={nodes.table} inject={<meshStandardMaterial color="green" />} />
```

Or make inserts conditional:

```jsx
<Clone object={nodes.table} inject={
  {(object) => (object.name === 'table' ? <meshStandardMaterial color="green" /> : null)}
} />
```
