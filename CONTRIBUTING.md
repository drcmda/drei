## Storybook

If you're adding a brand new feature, you need to make sure you add a storybook entry, here's a few tips:

- Make use of @storybook/addon-knobs to show component variants & configuration
- Keep the story simple & show the essence of the component, remember some people may be looking at using drei for the first time & it's important the stories are clear and concise.
- Keep assets minimal (3D Models, textures) to avoid bloating the repository
- If you think a more involved example is necessary, you can always add a codesandbox to the main README while keeping the story minimalistic
